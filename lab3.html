                        <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
                        <p>The overall objective of this lab is to sucessfully connect two ToF sensors and get measurements from both sensors simultaneously. Two Time-of-Flight sensors (VL53L1X) were given to measure the distances from objects. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Prelab</h2>
                        <p>Before setting up codes to use the sensor, I first had to figure out the approximate location of the sensor and permanently solder the connection between the Qwiic port and sensors. I consulted with the lab TAs as well as classmates for most efficient placements, and finalized the wiring connection as shown below. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab3/prelab.jpeg" width = "700"/></center>
                        <p>I decided to solder the sensors with the long QWIIC cables to maximize the mobility of the sensor location, and I am currently planning to put one sensor at the front of the robot and another at the side. In that case, I would potentially miss the obstacles in the back and the ones on the other side. The image below depicts the two sensors soldered and connected to the QWIIC breakout board. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab3/solder.jpg" width = "500"/></center>
                        <p>The problem of using two sensors simultaneously is that the I2C sensor address is the same for the two sensors. Two ways to solve the issue is to change one of the sensor's address in the beginning or use the XSHUT pin to turn one off to use another and alternate each time. Due to efficiency I chose to change the sensor address for one of the sensors in the setup code of the Artemis. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">I2C Channel sensor address</h2>
                        <p>Through compiling Apollo3's Example05_Wire_I2C.ino file, the Artemis detected the sensor with address 0x29. According to the datasheet, the pre-set address is 0x52, but the address is bit shifted, and the last bit (0) is used for read write status.  </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Three modes of ToF Sensors</h2>
                        <p>There are three modes of ToF sensors available: short, medium and long. According to the sensor's datasheet, the range of the sensor with varying lighting environment is as follows:</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab3/datasheet1.png" width = "600"/></center>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab3/datasheet2.png" width = "600"/></center>
                        <p>Although the long mode has much longer maximum distance measurment, it is fairly sensitive to ambient light. Thus, I concluded that <strong>short-distance mode</strong> is the right choice for this robot since it requires accuracy to be its top priority for accurate mapping or surroundings. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Testing Short distance mode</h2>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Using two ToF Sensors</h2>
                        <p>Aforementioned in the Prelab section, one of the two sensors either needs to shut down for the other one to be used or have its address changed in the beginning of code. Since it is inefficient to shut down and turn on each sensor every measurment, I decided to change one of the sensor's address. I connected one of the sensor's XSHUT pin with pin 8 in the Artemis and reset the address to 0x32 instead of the default 0x52 by turning off one of the sensors and setting the address through setI2CAddress(). </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab3/setup.png" width = "600"/></center>
                        <p>Then the two sensors are each defined under distanceSensor1 and distanceSensor2, so simultaneous measurements are possible. The following picture shows the simultaneous distance measurments, and the video attached also shows that the two sensors are measuring distance independently. </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">ToF sensor speed</h2>
                        <p>To measure the time it takes to measure the distance using the sensors, I got the initial time at the start of the loop and final time at the end of the loop and subtracted the two values to get the total time for one loop in the same code for getting the two sensor values. The code used and the output are attached below, and it turns out that it takes exactly 108 milliseconds to execute one loop. The limiting factor for the time seems to be the time for the sensor to output the distance measurements</p>
