                        <p>In order to build the state space model for my system, I had to estimate the drage and momentum terms for the A and B matrices (as written below). This was done by driving the car towards a wall while logging my motor and ToF sensor output. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab7/task1-1.jpg" width = "700"/></center>
                        <p>I decided on my step size using the maximum PWM value that was produced during my lab 6, which was around 100. </p>
                        <p>Below are the ToF sensor output, speed (computed), and the motor input of the system. Using the data, the steady state speed and the 90% rise time was found to be ___mm/s and ___ s, respectively.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Initializing KF</h2>
                        <p>Using the data obtained above, I implemented the Kalman Filter in Jupyter. Attached below are the code snippets of how KF was implemented in jupyter</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Implementing KF in Jupyter</h2>
                        <p>For the sigma matrices, I chose appropriate covariance matrices. Thus, now that the Kalman filter is ready, I iterated over the ToF values that I already had and applied the KF code. </p>
                        <p>This is the result of the Kalman filter. The blue line is the raw data taken from the sensor on the car, and the orange line is the data produced by the KF. As shown, the blue and orange line values are very similar to each other, which is what I wanted since I have enough confidence in my ToF sensor values. </p>
