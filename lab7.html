                        <p>In order to build the state space model for my system, I had to estimate the drage and momentum terms for the A and B matrices (as written below). This was done by driving the car towards a wall while logging my motor and ToF sensor output. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab7/task1-1.png" width = "500"/></center>
                        <p>I decided on my step size using the maximum PWM value that was produced during my lab 6, which was around 150. Thus, I gave the 150 PWM input to the motor until the car reached 100cm away from the wall. (PWM input shown below) </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab7/step_input.png" width = "500"/></center>
                        <p>Below are the ToF sensor output and the computed speed of the car during the step input. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab7/step_result1.png" width = "500"/></center>
                        <p>The maximum speed reached was 1654 mm/s with PWM value of 150. Using the data, the steady state speed and the 90% rise time was found to be around <b>1654 mm/s</b> and <b>1.27 s</b>, respectively.</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab7/step_result2.png" width = "500"/></center>
                        <p></p>

                        <p>Using the data obtained above, I implemented the Kalman Filter in Jupyter, by finalizing my A and B matrices using the steady state velocity and 90% rise time. To figure out d term (drag) of the system, we can calculate it using the steady state velocity (1654 mm/s) and u as 1. Thus, the d term came out to be <b>~0.00060</b>. </p>

                        <p>Using the 90% rise time and the d term, the m term came out to be <b>0.00033</b>.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Initializing KF</h2>
                        <p>With the newly found d and m values, I plugged them into the matrices to finalize the KF setup.</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab7/kf_A.png" width = "250"/><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab7/kf_B.png" width = "190"/></center>
                        <p>Since the KF needs process and measurement noise covariance matrices, I used the following equations to approximate the noise covariance values using the sampling rate. Since my sampling rate is ~0.18s, I substituted that value to finalize all matrices needed for the KF implementation.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Implementing KF in Jupyter</h2>
                        <p>Now that the Kalman filter is ready, I iterated over the ToF values that I already had from lab 6 and applied the KF code. </p>
                        <p>This is the result of the Kalman filter. The blue line is the raw data taken from the sensor on the car, and the orange line is the data produced by the KF. As shown, the blue and orange line values are very similar to each other, which is what I wanted since I have enough confidence in my ToF sensor values. </p>
