                        <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
                        <p>This objective of this lab was to set the IMU sensor to collect data from its accelerometer and gyroscope and get real-time roll, pitch and yaw information. Also, we equipped the Artemis, TOF sensors and IMU onto the robot, all powered through the given batteries. </p>
                        <p>We started off with setting up the IMU with the Artemis and analyzed its accelerometer and gyroscope data. Then, similar to the TOF sensor lab, we stored and sent the data through bluetooth, and finally, we connected all the sensors and batteries, and collected data from the RC car.  </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Setting up the IMU</h2>
                        <p>As shown in the image below, the IMU is connected to the Artemis, along with the two TOF sensors, through the QWIIC connectors.</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab4/task1-1.png" width = "400"/></center>
                        <p>To check the connection, we ran the example code from the IMU library, and the Serial Monitor showed the data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and the temperature sensor. In the example code, AD0_VAL represents the last bit of the IMU's I2C sensor. The default value is 0 because the ADR jumper is currently closed. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab4/task1-2.png" width = "700"/></center>
                        <p>When the sensor is lying flat, the x and y accelerometer data are 0 while the z acceleration is the gravitational acceleration (~1000mg).</p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab4/task1-3.png" width = "700"/></center>
                        <p>When plotted onto the Serial plotter in Arduino, it was noted that the accelerometer data was more noisy than the gyroscope data, which led to implementing a LPF on accelerometer data, as outlined below. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab4/task1-4.png" width = "700"/></center>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Accelerometer</h2>
                        <p>With the accelerometer data, we can only calculate the pitch and roll values using the equations from lecture. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab4/task2-1.png" width = "200"/></center>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab4/task2-2.png" width = "200"/></center>
                        <p>By implementing the equations onto the Artemis, we got the pitch and roll values from the IMU and plotted the data through the Serial Plotter. The following images depict the roll and pitch calculations at {-90, 0, 90} degrees. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab4/task2-3.png" width = "500"/></center>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab4/task2-4.png" width = "500"/></center>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Gyroscope</h2>
                        <p>With the gyroscope, pitch, roll and yaw values can be calculated using the following equations from lecture. </p>
                        <p>When compared with the accelerometer data, the gyroscope was more prone to errors when exposed to drift and quick vibrations. Furthermore, the range of the IMU is +/- 90 degrees for pitch and roll (as seen in data below), so we opted for a complimentary filter to ensure stable and accurate pitch and roll measurements. </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Sample Data</h2>
                        <p>We integrated the code from lab 2 and 3, such that the Artemis captured both ToF and IMU sensor measurements through bluetooth connection. For ease of processing, I sent the data in two smaller arrays, one for each sensor.  </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Cutting the cord</h2>
                        <p>To connect the battery to the Artemis, I cut the battery wires one at a time, soldered them onto the JST connector, and covered the connection with the heat shrink. The 650 mAh battery was used for the Artemis since the larger capacity battery was saved for motor battery power. </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab4/task5.jpg" width = "500"/></center>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Stunt!</h2>
                        <p>After mounting the 850 mAh battery onto the RC car, we played around with the car and found that it is very sensitive to inputs and hard to control. Rapid reverse in direction caused the car to flip and constant rotation input caused the car to spin at relatively constant position. </p>

                        <p>Finally, we taped the two ToF sensors, IMU and the Artemis onto the car and collected data over 5 seconds. Then, the data was sent over to the computer through bluetooth and plotted in python. </p>
