                        <p>In my case, since I chose Task A in PID control, I did a stunt of flipping the car. This stunt was executed in the lab space, where we had to start < 4m from the wall at the designated start lin, drive forward until it reaches the sticky mat, flips and drives back to the start line</p>
                        <p>Based on what the past students and my lab group members did, I first set the motor PWM value to 250 to drive forward as quickly as possible. </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Implementing into the robot</h2>
                        <p>Due to complications in the implementation, I decided to not use the Kalman Filter during this task and make it as simple as possible. The car first drives as fast as it can towards the wall, and when the ToF sensor value reaches certain point, it sends a backwards signal of 250 PWM value and returns back towards the starting line. The exact ToF value was decided through *multiple* trial and error, especially since my orientation of the robot was unique (explained below). </p>
                        <center><img class="center" src="assets/img/lab8/code.png" width = "350"/></center>
                        <p>Below are the videos of the full stunt trials. The first one is currently the best run, with <b>3.5 seconds</b> from the start to the end. The latter two trials did a successful flip, but did not pass the starting line. </p>
                        <p>The main issue, which is also shown in the video is that my right wheel is significanly stronger than my left. I first tried the stunt with calibration factor that I found in lab 5, by decreasing the PWM signal of the right wheel to 0.65 (significanly lower than my peers) of the given value. The robot did go straight with the calibration, but due to the decreased overall speed, the car just WOULD NOT FLIP!! Out of curiosity, I removed the calibration and tilted the car at the start to the right to prevent it from going completely to the left and ran it with full capacity on both of the wheels, and it worked. Although I could've tweaked the wheel mechanically and rearrange the mass distribution of my robot, I just concluded the lab with what I had due to time crunch. </p>

                        <p>Somehow the robot wanted to do 50% of task A and 50% of task B</p>
